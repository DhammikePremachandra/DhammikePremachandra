## About Me ‚ÑπÔ∏è


Hi there! I'm Dhammike Premachandra, an aspiring Data Analyst with a passion for extracting insights from data to drive informed decision-making. I am currently studying with Skills Bootcamp in Data Science at HyperionDev, where I am enhancing my skills in data analysis and visualization.

I recently graduated from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program, where I gained expertise in various data science tools and techniques. Additionally, I hold a bachelor's degree in Physical Science with majors in Computer Science and Geology from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.

With a strong foundation in both technical and analytical fields, I am excited to embark on a journey in the field of data analysis. My goal is to leverage my diverse background to contribute meaningfully to data-driven projects and make a positive impact in the industry.

## Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

- [**SPACEX FALCON 9 LANDING PREDICTION**](https://github.com/DhammikePremachandra/Python/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Prediction%20-%20SPACEX%20FALCON%209%20LANDING%20PREDICTION.ipynb): In this portfolio project, I tackled the challenge of predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings. SpaceX's innovative approach of reusing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rockets significantly reduces the cost of space missions, making it a game-changer in the aerospace industry. 
- [**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS OF MOVIE DATASET**](https://github.com/DhammikePremachandra/Python/blob/main/Movie%20Correlation%20Project.ipynb): In this portfolio project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a movie dataset to uncover insights into the factors influencing movie success, including budget, gross earnings, ratings, and more. The project involved data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- [**LONDON BIKE SHARING DASHBOARD**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dhammike.premachandra/vizzes): In this portfolio project, I delved into the realm of data analysis and visualization to uncover usage patterns and enhance service efficiency for London bike sharing. Leveraging factors such as temperature, wind speed, and time of day, I designed and implemented a dynamic Tableau dashboard to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
- [**NASHVILLE HOUSING DATASET ANALYSIS**](https://github.com/DhammikePremachandra/SQL/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning_NashvilleHousing.sql): In this portfolio project, I conducted comprehensive data cleaning and analysis on the Nashville Housing data set using SQL. By applying various SQL operations such as JOIN, VIEW, data transformation, and filtering techniques, I extracted valuable insights and improved reporting processes to enhance data quality and usability.
- [**EXCEL DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION**](https://github.com/DhammikePremachandra/Excel/blob/main/coffee%20Orders%20Dashboard.xlsx): In this Excel project, I undertook a comprehensive data analysis and visualization task, starting from data gathering to the creation of a dynamic and interactive dashboard. Leveraging advanced Excel functions such as XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, nested IF statements, and pivot tables, I transformed raw data into actionable insights and presented them in visually appealing charts and graphs.
